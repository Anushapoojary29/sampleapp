Developed a Flutter app for footwear, featuring separate interfaces for clients and sellers. The app utilizes Firebase for database management and manual OTP verification for user authentication. Payment transactions are handled through Razorpay, ensuring secure and seamless payments. The client side allows browsing and purchasing products, while the seller side manages inventory and orders. This setup provides a streamlined experience for both users and vendors.
